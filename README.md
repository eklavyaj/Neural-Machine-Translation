# Neural-Machine-Translation

- Built a standard sequence to sequence machine translation model to translate french phrases to english.
- Used an encoder-decoder architecture to capture the embeddings and perform decoding. 
- Evaluated the model using the Bleu Score calculated from unigrams and bigrams. 
- Achieved a good baseline of bleu score = 14.65. 
- Added attention to the model to better summarize the global context and make sound context-aware translations. 
- Achieved an improved bleu score of ~ 20.
